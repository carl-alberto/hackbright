# Pantheon / HackBright Data Challenge

## Schedule

* 6-6:30 Dinner, mingling
* 6:30-7:30 Group Problem Solving
* 7:30-8 Present as group

## Problem Solving

In 2016, we organized a community initiative dubbed [The Diversity Of The Web](https://github.com/drupaldiversity/diversity-of-the-web) to survey, understand and celebrated diversity in the web development community.  We got over 600 responses, about everything from gender identification to religious identification to disability identification.

Your task is to answer some questions from the result data, and prepare it for a 5-minute [group presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/17szOwIovthOAp7VDMi8wk6GR-KDywbMFZKvUqoIl_7o/edit#slide=id.g20835186bb_0_59).  

Here's what that might look like as a user-story:

> As a member of the web community, I want insights into the diversity of the web-development community, so that I can better understand how to interact with and improve the community.

## Resources

Join [this Slack channel](https://diversityoftheweb.slack.com/shared_invite/MTY5NjYwNDQyNDA0LTE0OTIyMDk2MjktNDc4MmMxMTY2OQ), for sharing links, requesting additional snacks, etc.

Here's how you can get the data:

* [Live Survey](https://www.getfeedback.com/r/YTxWLJqn/53172847-72b1-4d7a-8b56-8f800df84587)
* [Survey Questions](https://github.com/drupaldiversity/diversity-of-the-web/blob/master/SURVEY.md)
* [Results as a CSV](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pantheon-systems/hackbright/master/cleaned_response_data_4_13_17.csv)
* [Results as SQL](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pantheon-systems/hackbright/master/cleaned_response_data_4_13_17.sql)
* [Results as Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PYJk_vx6eOO2cosqywD0-ZhQM6Eki8RA0r_F2tw9V4I/edit#gid=1641068829)
* Development environments on Pantheon with the data pre-loaded into MySQL (Ask Nick for a connection string)

## Here's what we're looking for:

* Quantity/Difficulty: Can you answer all the questions?  The difficult questions?
* Accuracy: Can you answer the questions accurately?
* Time/team management: Can you work as a group with a timing constraint? (hint: fewer answers beats no presentation)
* Presentation/Communication: Can you communicate the answers to your questions?
