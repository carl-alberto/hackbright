# Pantheon / HackBright Data Challenge

In 2016, we organized a community initiative dubbed [The Diversity Of The Web](https://github.com/drupaldiversity/diversity-of-the-web) to survey, understand and celebrated diversity in the web development community.  We got over 600 responses, about everything from gender identification to relgious identification to disability identification.

Your task is to derive some insights from the result data, and prepare it for presentation.  The deliverable could be HTML, a Google Presentation, or a whiteboard.

Here's what that might look like as a user-story:

> As a member of the web community, I want insights into the diversity of the web-development community, so that I can better understand how to interact with and improve the community.

Specifically, these are the "Acceptance Criteria", the minimum needed to satisfy the requirements.

> Given I am a member of the web community, when I view the analysis, there are three insights presented

> Given I am a member of the web community, when I view the analysis, the data driving the insights is present and visualized

## Resources

Join [this Slack channel](https://diversityoftheweb.slack.com/shared_invite/MTY5NjYwNDQyNDA0LTE0OTIyMDk2MjktNDc4MmMxMTY2OQ), for sharing links, etc.

Here's how you can get the data:

* [Results as a CSV](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pantheon-systems/hackbright/master/cleaned_response_data_4_13_17.csv)
* [Results as SQL](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pantheon-systems/hackbright/master/cleaned_response_data_4_13_17.sql)
* [Results as Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PYJk_vx6eOO2cosqywD0-ZhQM6Eki8RA0r_F2tw9V4I/edit#gid=1641068829)
* Development environments on Pantheon with the data pre-loaded into MySQL

## Here's what we're looking for:

* Time management: Can you meet the requirements within the time period (hint: get something end-to-end and refine)?
* Analysis: Are you able to jump into an unfamiliar dataset and derive insights/value?
* Visualization/Articulation: Once you find an insight, are you able to effectively communicate that?

## TODO:
* Get our 'before your interview', print several copies.
* Assign groups: Krejci, Ben, Kim, Adam, Me.
* Add basic index.php to site, with logo and # of responses.
* Print out 4x of the Readme
* AV Setup for Thursday, ask steven.
* Dinner setup.  Should be OK.
