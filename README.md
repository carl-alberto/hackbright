# Pantheon / HackBright Data Challenge

In 2016, we organized a [community initiative](https://github.com/drupaldiversity/diversity-of-the-web) to survey, understand and celebrated diversity in the web development community.  We got over 600 responses, about everything from gender identification to relgious identification to disability identification.

Your task is to derive some insights from the result data, and prepare it for presenation.  The deliverable could be HTML, a Google Presentation, or a whiteboard.

Here's what that might look like as a user-story:

> As a member of the web community, I want insights into the diversity of the web-development community, so that I can better understand how to interact with and improve the community.

Specifically, these are the "Acceptance Criteria", the minimum needed to satisfy the requirements.

> Given I am a member of the web community, when I view the analysis, there are three insights presented

> Given I am a member of the web community, when I view the analysis, the data driving the insights is present and visualized
